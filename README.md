# Kaitenzushi - Japanese Typing Game
Do you like sushi? Are you familiar with Japan? This game is designed not only for practicing speed typing but also for learning the Japanese language and food culture in a fun way. 
  
> This game’s idea is coming from well-known speed typing game “Sushida” (寿司打) in Japan. The aim of the game is to get as many sushi dishes on the conveyer belt in a Kaitenzushi restaurant. You have to hurry because if you are slow or indecisive, you’ll miss your favourite dishes. The original game is made for native Japanese who know the words already, those words and pictures are not related and more focus on typing speed.   [CREDITS - Sushida ](#credits-content) 
  
My challenge is to modify this game and to set the target user for non-native Japanese speakers by introducing basic words with associated pictures, and giving them a virtual experience of Kaitenzushi restaurant.

## Live site

**[Live site >> https://atsukocoffey.github.io/kaitenzushi/](https://atsukocoffey.github.io/kaitenzushi/)**


# UX DESIGN

## 1. Strategy Plane
### Target users 
1.	Intended to target people who are interested in Japan.
2.	Also those who are learning Japanese and culture.
3.  Additionally those who are not familiar with Japan but simply like to play speed typing game.

### User value 
1.	Users can find Japanese culture, sushi menu and greeting words etc..
2.	Users can challenge their typing speed .
3.	Users can learn the Japanese characters and words by playing the game.

### Difference from substitutions
1.  This game is not a typical speed typing game, it focuses on learning Japanese words and letters.
2.  Associated images help with visual attraction, and also provide visual learning aid.

## 2. Scope Plane

# EXISTING FEATURES

## The Header And Sound Control Bar      
The logo is writing "Kaiten zushi" in Japanese. I looked for some ordinary real flags and banners for Kaitenzushi restaurant, then traced and arranged to use. The English logo displays a bit more groovy and also the bottom lines convey speed so I thought this fit well to a speed typing game.   

![Kaitenzushi logo and sound control toggle button](readme/feat-header.png "Kaitenzushi logo and sound control toggle button")     

## Landing and name input modal     
Originally this feature was separate, then I wanted to simplify and have less action for the user so I used setTimeout to automatically show name input modal. This may not be the best way as it looks like just loading problem, not clear it's intended to show like this. If I could use some css animation for this transition, it could be more smooth though I think.    

![Landing and name input modal](readme/feat-setting-modal.png "Landing and name input modal")
  

## Entering the game setting button
Originally I planned another course that can learn Japanese greetings and phrases though I couldn't figure it from the selection functions in Javascript. The mode option is the same, I need more time to figure it out so end up only having one game option .   

![Setting modal - course, sound option, mode then proceed to start game](readme/feat-setting-modal.png "Setting modal - course, sound option, mode then proceed to start game")   

## The Footer  
The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites. The links will pop open a new tab so that the game window is still open. Also the heading text "Japanese word typing game" explains what this site is so that it shows up all the time in the footer.  

![The footer](readme/feat-footer.png "The footer")   


## Game setting modal     
![Game setting modal](readme/feat-setting-modal.png "Game setting modal")    
In this area, user can choose the some setting. However I couldn't have enough time so there's only one option for question course and play modes.

## Game screen 

Game screen shows questions pictures, time limit and text overlay when correct typing.
After some device test, score display under the game took some spaces, that interupted to see the words and pictures in iPhone so change this to toggle on off display using `details` element.

# ALGORITHM
Below numbered lists are my original idea of the game system. Also just underneath the list, [BUG] sentences that describe the main problems with the features.   
 
I had never created a whole game before, so I was unsure if this was achievable within the given time or not. As a precaution, I set a lower accomplishment goal to prepare for submitting within a short time frame. After that then I can try extra features that I hope I can implement until submission day. On the other hand, Japanese kana letter matching function was more complicated than I expected so I decided to make it an extra feature. 
 
**1. Create a new shufﬂed question**   
[BUG](#bugs) BUG Just random array -> I want shuffle properly  
 
**2. Set & start Global time limit (60s)**  
[BUG](#bugs)  

**3. Display ﬁrst question image & texts**   
[BUG](#bugs) display images  
 
**4. Set one word timer (10s) per question -> Move on next**  
[BUG](#bugs) After complete the word still that time limit is working -> This time limit need to be cancelled when next question is executed.  
 
**5. Detect user entry - Set on focus to input, set window.event to identify the key**   
[BUG](#bugs) keyboard nor input event didn't work for mobile device (I didn't want to use button)   
  
**6. Input key matching -> matched key -> Letter matched counter +1, change the display using css, executes typing sound**   
[BUG](#bugs) Changing the colour of a letter one by one in the word seems impossible.    
My solution is using an another layer which was applied the style already, push the matched letter in it to look like to change the letter colour one by one.   
[BUG](#bugs) Mobile device doesn't work the matching function as the keyboard system is different. Temporary, use return key to lead to validate function for mobile phone.  
[BUG](#bugs) Matching function for Japanese kana letters were much more complicated than I expected. I tried some if statement though decided to postpone to try later. 
 
**7. Change user entry to the lower case**  
  
**8. Automatically clear the input area after (0.5 s)**  
 
**9. Unmatched key -> sound < boo > , mistake counter**  
 
**10. Validate the word function - If matched word counter + 1 and start new game. Reset the letter counter to 0**   
[BUG](#bugs) Because input key matching `hundleKeyPress()` did not function for mobile device, make this can handle 2 ways of  validations.   
[BUG](#bugs) `innerText` and `value` property.  



# FUTURE FEATURES
* Animation - Question’s word image. Move from left to right (in 10 seconds)
* Award extra time for correct responses.
* Another course - Not only sushi menu, Japanese greetings or words  
* Japanese kana overlay - Changeellow colour words 
* Award extra time for correct responses.

# BUGS

## Unfixed bug
### An invalid form control with name='' is not focusable  
My `button` and `input submit` doesn't work form validation when I set the event listener to the element.
I tried this `setCustomValidity` but not really successed yet.   
![Bug form validation](readme/bug-form-validation-javascript.png "Bug form validation")   

After I set the `setCustomValidity` still received this alert.   
![Bug form validation](readme/bug-invalid-form-control.png "Bug form validation")   

I found this article and change my button element though, unfortunately still I have bug alert.
![alt text](readme/bug-setcustomvalidity.png)   


## Fixed bug

### Create a new shufﬂed question  `shuffledWords()`
First I found this to shuffle in stackoverflow `const randomElement = array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];`   
 
![Getting a random value from a JavaScript array - Stack Overflow](readme/bug-shuffle-get-random-value.png "Getting a random value from a JavaScript array - Stack Overflow")   
    
But that creates a random array literally and what I wanted was to shuffle properly, meaning I didn't want to show the same word a few times in the array. I tried using `pop` and `push`, but I couldn’t find out a better way or a popular convention.   
 
Solution : **Fisher Yates Shuffle**   
![`const randomElement = array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)`](readme/bug-shuffle-stackoverflow.png "Google Lighthouse audit index.html - stackoverflow") 
 
### Set & start Global time limit `startGame()`  
I implement the reset code that clears out the display texts and the input texts in the start game function. Then, I got an error which  `innerText` property wasn't working well.   

![`innerText` and `value` property.](readme/bug-innertext-to-value.png "`innerText` and `value` property.")   
 
Solution :   
The difference between `innerText` and `value` property was that value was used for form elements.
 
### Display ﬁrst question image & texts   
I was wondering how to hold image’s data in the array, but after this researching, I found that what I needed it was a just text path. It wasn't difficult than I thought. But after implemented it I got link error. Because I was writing in assets’ JavaScript file, even though this code will be executed from index.html    
 
Solution :  
Fix the path from index.html  
 
### Set one word timer (10s) per question -> Move on next word   
My global timer which executes when the page is loaded, is working fine so I tried to use the `setTimeout` method same way. But for one word timer it didn't work well with `clearTimeout` method. This timer need to be cancelled when next question is executed or users have completed the typing successfully. Under below was an article at stackoverflow, I understand the variable should be in global scope but my code didn't use any variable. I looked for MDN or W3chool but still I didn't find out my problem. So I asked to perplexity, it explained me really well what was my problem.   
![setting timeout stackoverflow1](readme/bug-setting-timeout.png "`stackoverflow1")   
![setting timeout stackoverflow2](readme/bug-setting-timeout2.png "`stackoverflow2")   
![setting timeout perplexity](readme/bug-setting-timeoutp.png "`setting timeout perplexity")   
 Solution :   
Use a variable to make sure that the correct `setTimeout` identifier for passing to `clearTimeout` 
 
  
### Input key matching `handleKeyPress()` 
This function finds matched key, then if there's add +1 to the Letter counter, then change the display using css, executes typing sound.    
My original plan "changing the colour of a letter one by one in the word" seems difficult if the data is already a word.    
My solution was using the another layer which was applied the style already, push the matched letter in it to look like to change the letter colour one by one.   
[BUG](#bug-handleKeyPress) Mobile device doesn't work the matching function, maybe the keyboard system is deffent. Temporary, use keyboard "return" key to lead to validate function for mobile phone.   
[Future feature](#future-features) Matching function for japanese kana letters were much more complicated than I expected. I tried some if statement though decided to postpone to try later in the future.

<a link="bug-handleKeyPress"></a>

## Detect user entry - Set on focus to input, set window.event to identify the key     
[BUG]`keypress` nor `input` event listener didn't work for mobile device (I didn't want to use button for visual purpose)  
I spent long time to dealing with this issue, I tried to use `touchstart` `touchend` `click` as well.
Finally I could solve this issue after I learned `target` property from tutor Sean at [BUG](bug-audiocontroll) AUDIO CONTROL CHECKBOXES 
This issue is related to "Input key matching `handleKeyPress()`" too.
 
## Change user entry to the lower case   
I found the input from the mobile phone, usually auto Capitalise first letter. That interupts to play game. I set `toLowerCase()` in Javascript, but some mobile devises not work (I assume this because not using `target` property). My mentor Alan teach me about this auto capitalise off attribute.   
![Auto capitalise off - useful input attributes](readme/bug-autocapitalize-off.png "Auto capitalise off -useful input attributes")   

 
## Validate the word function `validateInput()` 
If matched word counter + 1 and start new game. Reset the letter counter to 0   
[BUG] Because input key matching `hundleKeyPress()` did not function for mobile device, I made this can handle both ways of validations.    
 
Solution : 
Set conditons for keyboard and use `||` logical operator to mobile device. Keyboard validation can use the overlay text which were generated by mey matching function though mobile validation use direct user input data.    
  
Later I found this function wasn't working in the mobile device, because same issu as `startGame()`   
![`innerText` and `value` property.](readme/bug-innertext-to-value.png "")


[BUG] `innerText` and `value` property.  

Stopped the correct letter counting at `handleKeyPress` one by one. So I tried to add the letter counter's number when validate the word. How ever, `textDisplay.length` wasn't a number. I found the using console to checking is really useful.    

![TextDisplay.length](readme/bug-getting-number-of-length.png "`TextDisplay.length")


## Display of the global time limits
I had a problem with Global time limit also I wanted to show the time limit on the screen.
I found the better way than `setTimeout`.

## AUDIO CONTROL CHECKBOXES

When I was working on this audio control checkbox, it was just the timing to Gitpod migration. I made a commitment though it wasn’t succeeded in my new Gitpod environment. I noticed the terminal text's colour was different but I didn’t really look at the warning by my mistake. I want to leave my track here for detail references.
Beforehand I implemented the `turnOnSound()` function to see the checkbox can control the audio files. There were 5 audio files so I used for loop to iterate to go through each other. At this time code was really simple, using just if statement and iterate `muted = false` all the checkboxes. So this time I duplicated the checkboxes into the nav toggle header menu. What I wanted to do was the linking those same function buttons. If a checkbox at main div was checked then header nav’s same function checkbox is checked automatically along with audio control. There are 3 types of controls and all duplicated so same function’s checkboxes are 2 each, I tried to get the array from get ElementsByClassName, and specify with using index number to connect to 3 different functions. Also added event listener `click` and use `if statement` to toggle the audio muted attribute; automatically checked or unchecked. Strangely it worked half way. When I checked the other checkbox was checked automatically and audio controlling OK, but can’t uncheck again and not control audio anymore. For a while I tried to solve it but didn’t work, and this point I failed to the commitment.
Tutor Sean at Tutor support helped me to solve this problem, he checked one by one my code and he suggested me to use event listener “change” also using “event.target” then this checkbox worked properly. Also he used .forEach method even only 2 in the array, it might be simpler than specify one by one.

## TYPING AREA – INPUT TEXT AREA FOR MOBILE KEYBOARD ISSUE
From Audio control bug I learned `change` event listener and using `event.target` to specify precisely that solved some errors. I had an issue with mobile devise only, both `validateInput()` and `handleKeypress()` functions didn’t work properly. I thought it might be similar problem so I asked this issue to tutor support again. I was trying to fix this issue long time with using event listener `input` `keypress` `touchstart` `touchend`. Tutor Sean suggested me to use `change` or `keydown` `keyup`. `keydown` worked for Mac OS mobiles, iPhone and iPad, but I found it didn’t work for android OS later.
I tried to change `const key = event.key` to `const key = event.target.value` in the `handleKeypress()` to see work on Android OS phone, finally it had succeeded to work on Android OS phone. However not perfectly, there is a problem still that is the event doesn't immediately change the overlay text in Android OS phone. The issue makes user can't find out the input was correct or not immediately. 
Next I did was the input text event listener, I tried `change` from `keydown` that brings backword; `handleKeyPress()` doesn't work at all. Then tried `input` it seems this is the best way; input value immediately goes to `handleKeyPress()` and change the ovelay text. I found an another problem that is the text user input in the mobile keyboard, user have to erase it by their self. But this is mobile kyboard system and not under the this website control, so leave this issue for a future impruvement.
