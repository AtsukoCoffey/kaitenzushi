# Kaitenzushi - Japanese Typing Game
Do you like sushi? Are you familiar with Japan? This game is designed not only for practicing speed typing but also for learning the Japanese language and some culture in a fun way.  
  
> This game’s idea is coming from well-known speed typing game “Sushida” (寿司打) in Japan. The game situation is setting to get as much as sushi dishes on the conveyer belt in Kaitenzushi restaurant. You have to hurry as if you are slow or indecisive, you’ll miss your favourite dishes. Original game is made for native Japanese who know the words already, those words and pictures are not related and more focus on typing speed.  [CREDITS - Sushida ](#credits-content) 
  
My challenge is to modify this game and to set the target user for non-native Japanese speaker with introducing basic words with aligned pictures, and give them virtual experience of Kaitenzushi restaurant.

# UX DESIGN

## 1. Strategy Plane
### Target users 
1.	Intended to target the people who are interested in Japan.
2.	Also who are learning Japanese and culture.
3.  Additionally who are not familiar with Japan but simply like to play with speed typing game.

### User value 
1.	Users can find Japaese culture, sushi menu and greeting words etc..
2.	Users can play with speed typing game.
3.	Users can learn the Japanese charactors and words throughout the playing game.

### Difference from substitutions
1.  This game is not typical speed typing game, focusing to learn Japanese words and letters.
2.  Animated images are helping users attractions, to encourage learning.

### Figure And Picture Element 

In the upcoming session section, I consider using the `<figure>` element for an image and the `<picture>` element for UI responsivity. But I wasn’t familiar with both elements to use so I looked for some hints. I couldn’t find out how to use both in the W3 school or MDN though there were some coversations at stackoverflow and I also asked perplexity whether I could include picture element in the figure element. It doesn't seem to be a problem to include it.

### Hero Image CSS Animation Scale 1 to 1.1 
When I learned this css animation technique through the “Love Running” project in Code Institute, I was amazed to discover that I could create animation without Java Script, which was common 20 years ago.

<a id="credits-breadcrumb"></a>

### Breadcrumb
I looked for suitable elements for the breadcrumb links. In W3 website the answer was `<nav>` and using aria attribute for describing the location. Moreover I got an opportunity to learn about `::before` pseudo selector in relation to this.

### Form  Autocomplete Attribute
Google Lighthouse audit suggested me to use autocomplete attribute for form, and I found this is really helpful for user.  

* [Link to MDN website - Form autocomplete attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete "Form autocomplete attributer")

### Form Input Pattern Attribute
My mentor Alan taught me about this `<input>` pattern attribute for preventing invalid form data submission.
EG. for alphabet only and 3 letters `pattern="[A-Za-z]{3}"`  

* [Link to W3schools website - Form input pattern attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_pattern.asp#:~:text=The%20pattern%20attribute%20specifies%20a,pattern%20to%20help%20the%20user "Form input pattern attribute")

### Hero Image Optimizing For LCP
The hero image is not a small size image. After I read this article, I tried to optimize the reading time of the hero image using `<link rel="preload">` for increasing LCP score.

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

---

Happy coding! -->
